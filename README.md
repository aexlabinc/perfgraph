Getting started:

- Ensure that NodeJS is installed: https://nodejs.org/
- Clone or download this repository
- Run `npm install` to download dependencies
- Run `npm run start` to start the server
- Once running, browse to: http://localhost:3000

Profiling data is stored locally in a SQLite database file called `perfgraph.db`. If you experience problems aftering updating perfgraph, or if you just want to clear all data and start fresh, you can simply delete `perfgraph.db` while the server is not running.
